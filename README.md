# wxCurl
Clone of improved wxCurl from OpenCPN. wxCURL is a simplified and integrated interface between LibCURL and wxWidgets. 

As libCURL authors state, libcurl is free, thread-safe, IPv6 compatible, feature rich, well supported, 
fast, thoroughly documented and is already used by many known, big and successful companies and numerous 
applications. 

wxCURL provides several sub-classes for simplified interfaces to HTTP, WebDAV, FTP and Telnet based resources, 
threads specialized for non-blocking downloads/uploads, stock download and upload dialogs.
